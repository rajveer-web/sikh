    <td width="504"><p class="style34">Gurupurabs are anniversaries associated with  the lives of the Sikh Gurus. The Sikhs celebrate 10 Gurpurabs in a year. At  each of these festivals, one of the ten gurus of the Khalsa Pantha is honored.  Of these the important ones are the birthdays of Guru Nanak and Guru Govind  Singh and the martyrdom days of Guru Arjun Dev and Guru Teg Bahadur.&nbsp;<br />
      Guru Nanak's jayanti falls in the month of  Kartik (October / November). The Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak brought  enlightenment to the world, hence the festival is also called Prakash Utsav,  the festival of light. The Tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, was born on 2 December 1666  in Patna. The martyrdom day of the fifth Guru, Arjun Dev falls in the months of  May and June and that of the ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, in November.<br />
      Gurupurab         Guru  Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith, was born in a Punjabi village (presently  in Pakistan) in 1469. Always secular in his outlook, he even organized a  canteen where Muslims and Hindus of all castes could come and eat together. It  is believed that he had a vision from god, in Sultanpur, directing him to  preach to mankind.<br />
    Guru Gobind Singh forged the distinctive identity of the Sikhs  and called them Khalsa (the pure) and made it mandatory for them to have the  five Ks - Kesh (hair), Kripan (dagger), Kada (bracelet), Kangha (comb) and  Kachcha (underwear). Guru Arjun Dev was burnt alive at the stake in the hot  months of May and June and Guru Teg Bahadur was beheaded in Delhi.<br ar="all" />

    <td><p class="style34"><strong>Vaisakhi</strong>&nbsp;(LAST&nbsp;<em>visākhī</em>),  also known as&nbsp;<strong>Baisakhi</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Vaishakhi</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Vasakhi</strong>&nbsp;is  a historical and religious festival in&nbsp;Sikhism&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hinduism. It is  usually celebrated on April 13 or 14 every year.[4][5]<br />
      Vaisakhi marks birth of the Khalsa way of living in the Sikh  religion.[2][1]and  commemorates the formation of&nbsp;Khalsa panth of warriors under Guru Gobind Singh&nbsp;in 1699.[6][7]&nbsp;It  is additionally a spring harvest festival for the Sikhs.[6]Vaisakhi  is also an ancient festival of Hindus, marking the Solar New Year and also  celebrating the spring harvest.[7]&nbsp;It  marks the sacredness of rivers in Hindu culture, it is regionally known by many  names, but celebrated in broadly similar ways.[8][9]&nbsp;Indian subcontinent<br />
      Vaisakhi observes major events in the history of Sikhism and  the&nbsp;Indian subcontient&nbsp;that happened in  the&nbsp;Punjab region[10][11]he  significance of Vaisakhi as a major Sikh festival marking the birth of Sikh  order started after the persecution and execution of&nbsp;Guru Tegh Bahadur&nbsp;for refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the  Mughal Emperor&nbsp;Aurangzeb. This triggered the coronation of the  tenth Guru of Sikhism and the historic formation of&nbsp;Khalsa, both on the Vaisakhi day.[12][13][14]&nbsp;Vaisakhi  was also the day when colonial British empire officials committed the&nbsp;Jallianwala Bagh massacre&nbsp;on a gathering, an event influential to the Indian  movement against colonial rule.[10]<br />
    On Vaisakhi, Gurdwaras are decorated and hold&nbsp;Kirtans, Sikhs visit and bathe in lakes or  rivers before visiting local Gurdwaras, community fairs and&nbsp;<em>nagar  kirtan</em>&nbsp;processions are held, and people gather to socialise and share  festive foods.[5][10][15]or  many Hindus, the festival is their traditional solar new year, a harvest  festival, an occasion to bathe in sacred rivers such as Ganges, Jhelum and  Kaveri, visit temples, meet friends and party over festive foods. This festival  in Hinduism is known by various regional names.[9]<br ar="all" />

    <td><p class="style34"><strong>Bandi Chhor Divas</strong>&nbsp;(&quot;Day of  Liberation&quot;) (ਬੰਦੀ ਛੋੜ ਦਿਵਸ) is a&nbsp;Sikh&nbsp;holiday  which coincides with the day of&nbsp;Diwali Sikhs historically celebrated Diwali  along with Hindus, with [[Guru Hargobind sahib ji ]] explicitly listing it  along with&nbsp;Vaisakhi&nbsp;as a  festival for Sikhs.[1][2][3<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandi_Chhor_Divas#cite_note-3">]</a>&nbsp;In  late 20th century, Sikh religious leaders increasingly called Diwali as Bandi  Chhor Divas, and the&nbsp;Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committe adopted this name along with the&nbsp;aki calenn 20darshahNani03.[4]<br />
      Unlike  the Hindu festival of&nbsp;Diwali&nbsp;whose  significance is based on the texts and scriptures of&nbsp;Hinduism Bandi  Chhor Divas celebrates a Sikh historic event related to the sixth Guru,&nbsp;Guru Hargobind According to Sikh history, on this day, Guru Hargobind was  released from prison by the Mughal Emperor&nbsp;Jahangir&nbsp;who  freed 52 other Hindu kings with him.[5][6][7],<br />
    The  Bandi Chhor Divas is celebrated in a manner similar to Diwali, with the  lighting of homes and Gurdwaras, feasts, gift giving and family time. It is an  important Sikh celebration along with Vaisakhi, Maghi, Holi with Hola Mohalla  and Gurpurab.[4][8]<br ar="all" />

    <td><p class="style34"><strong>Maghi</strong>&nbsp;is the annual festival and one of the seasonal gathering  of the&nbsp;Sikhs.[1]&nbsp;It  is celebrated at Muktsar in the memory of forty Sikh martyrs (<em>Chalis Mukte</em>),  who once had deserted the tenth and last human Guru of&nbsp;Sikhism,Guru Gobind Singh&nbsp;at Anandpur Sahib, but later rejoined the Guru and died  while fighting the&nbsp;Mughal Empire&nbsp;army  led by Wazir Khan in 1705.[1]&nbsp;Sikhs  make a pilgrimage to the site of this Sikh-Muslim war, and take a dip in the  sacred water tanks of Muktsar.[2][3]<br />
      A fair (<em>mela</em>) is held at Muktsar Sahib every year and  called the&nbsp;Mela Maghi&nbsp;is  held in memory of the forty Sikh martyrs.[4]Before  this tradition started to commemorate the Sikh martyrs who gave their lives to  protect the tenth Guru, the festival was observed and mentioned by&nbsp;Guru Amar das, the third Guru of Sikhism.[5].<br />
      Makar Sankranti&nbsp;celebrated in other parts  of Indian subcontinent by Hindus, is known as Maghi in Punjab[6]&nbsp;and is always on the  first day of the month of&nbsp;Magha in Bikrami calenda<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikrami_calendar" title="Bikrami calendar">r</a>. On Maghi, when the sun takes  its northern journey on entering the sign of Makara or Capricorn, the Hindus  take bath in the Ganges or if that is not possible, in some other river,  rivulet, canal or pond.[6]It  follows the festival of Lohri &nbsp;in north India,  particularly popular in the&nbsp;Punjab region[7]<br />
    Maghi is celebrated by people eating&nbsp;kheer&nbsp;such  as Rauh di kheer which is an old dish where rice is cooked in sugarcane juice.  The dish is prepared in the evening before Maghi and is kept to cool. It is  served cold next morning on Maghi with red-chilly mixed curd.[8]&nbsp;In  some parts of&nbsp;Punjab,india it is also traditional to  eat&nbsp;kichdi mixed with lentils, consume raw  sugarcane and&nbsp;Jaggery,[9] Fairs  are held at many places on Maghi.[10]<br ar="all" />

    <td><p align="justify" class="style34"><strong>Hola Mohalla</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Hola Mahalla</strong>&nbsp;or  simply&nbsp;<strong>Hola</strong>&nbsp;is a Sikh festival that takes place on the first  of the lunar month of&nbsp;Chet which  usually falls in&nbsp;<strong>March</strong>. This, by a tradition established by&nbsp;Guru Gobind Singh follows the Hindu festival of  Holi by one day; Hola is the masculine form of the feminine sounding&nbsp;<strong>Holi</strong>.<br />
      The word&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Mohalla&quot;</strong>&nbsp;is derived from the  Arabic root&nbsp;<strong>hal</strong>&nbsp;(alighting, descending) and is a Punjabi word  that implies an organized procession in the form of an army column. But unlike  Holi, when people playfully sprinkle colored powder, dry or mixed in water, on  each other, the Guru made&nbsp;Hola Mohalla&nbsp;an occasion for the Sikhs to  demonstrate their martial skills in simulated battles.<br />
    Together the words&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Hola Mohalla&quot;</strong>&nbsp;stands  for &quot;mock fight&quot;. During this festival, processions are organised in  the form of army type columns accompanied by war-drums and standard-bearers and  proceeding to a given spot or moving in state from one&nbsp;gurdwara to another. The custom  originated in the time of Guru Gobind Singh&nbsp;who held the first such  mock fight event at&nbsp;Anandpur in February  1701.<br ar="all" />
