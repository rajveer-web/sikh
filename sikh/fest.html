At  each of these festivals, one of the ten gurus of the Khalsa Pantha is honored.  Of these the important ones are the birthdays of Guru Nanak and Guru Govind  Singh and the martyrdom days of Guru Arjun Dev and Guru Teg Bahadur.&nbsp;<br />
      Guru Nanak's jayanti falls in the month of  Kartik (October / November). The Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak brought  enlightenment to the world, hence the festival is also called Prakash Utsav,  the festival of light. The Tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, was born on 2 December 1666  in Patna. The martyrdom day of the fifth Guru, Arjun Dev falls in the months of  May and June and that of the ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, in November.<br />
      Gurupurab         Guru  Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith, was born in a Punjabi village (presently  in Pakistan) in 1469. Always secular in his outlook, he even organized a  canteen where Muslims and Hindus of all castes could come and eat together. It  is believed that he had a vision from god, in Sultanpur, directing him to  preach to mankind.<br />
    Guru Gobind Singh forged the distinctive identity of the Sikhs  and called them Khalsa (the pure) and made it mandatory for them to have the  five Ks - Kesh (hair), Kripan (dagger), Kada (bracelet), Kangha (comb) and  Kachcha (underwear). Guru Arjun Dev was burnt alive at the stake in the hot  months of May and June and Guru Teg Bahadur was beheaded in Delhi.<br ar="all" />

      Unlike  the Hindu festival of&nbsp;Diwali&nbsp;whose  significance is based on the texts and scriptures of&nbsp;Hinduism Bandi  Chhor Divas celebrates a Sikh historic event related to the sixth Guru,&nbsp;Guru Hargobind According to Sikh history, on this day, Guru Hargobind was  released from prison by the Mughal Emperor&nbsp;Jahangir&nbsp;who  freed 52 other Hindu kings with him.<br />
    The  Bandi Chhor Divas is celebrated in a manner similar to Diwali, with the  lighting of homes and Gurdwaras, feasts, gift giving and family time. It is an  important Sikh celebration along with Vaisakhi, Maghi, Holi with Hola Mohalla  and Gurpurab.<br ar="all" />

      A fair (<em>mela</em>) is held at Muktsar Sahib every year and  called the&nbsp;Mela Maghi&nbsp;is  held in memory of the forty Sikh martyrs.Before  this tradition started to commemorate the Sikh martyrs who gave their lives to  protect the tenth Guru, the festival was observed and mentioned by&nbsp;Guru Amar das, the third Guru of Sikhism.<br />
      Makar Sankranti&nbsp;celebrated in other parts  of Indian subcontinent by Hindus, is known as Maghi in Punjab&nbsp;and is always on the  first day of the month of&nbsp;Magha in Bikrami calenda<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikrami_calendar" title="Bikrami calendar">r</a>. On Maghi, when the sun takes  its northern journey on entering the sign of Makara or Capricorn, the Hindus  take bath in the Ganges or if that is not possible, in some other river,  rivulet, canal or pond.[6]It  follows the festival of Lohri &nbsp;in north India,  particularly popular in the&nbsp;Punjab region<br />
    Maghi is celebrated by people eating&nbsp;kheer&nbsp;such  as Rauh di kheer which is an old dish where rice is cooked in sugarcane juice.  The dish is prepared in the evening before Maghi and is kept to cool. It is  served cold next morning on Maghi with red-chilly mixed curd.&nbsp;In  some parts of&nbsp;Punjab,india it is also traditional to  eat&nbsp;kichdi mixed with lentils, consume raw  sugarcane and&nbsp;Jaggery, Fairs  are held at many places on Maghi.<br ar="all" />

This, by a tradition established by&nbsp;Guru Gobind Singh follows the Hindu festival of  Holi by one day; Hola is the masculine form of the feminine sounding&nbsp;<strong>Holi</strong>.<br />
      The word&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Mohalla&quot;</strong>&nbsp;is derived from the  Arabic root&nbsp;<strong>hal</strong>&nbsp;(alighting, descending) and is a Punjabi word  that implies an organized procession in the form of an army column. But unlike  Holi, when people playfully sprinkle colored powder, dry or mixed in water, on  each other, the Guru made&nbsp;Hola Mohalla&nbsp;an occasion for the Sikhs to  demonstrate their martial skills in simulated battles.<br />
    Together the words&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Hola Mohalla&quot;</strong>&nbsp;stands  for &quot;mock fight&quot;. During this festival, processions are organised in  the form of army type columns accompanied by war-drums and standard-bearers and  proceeding to a given spot or moving in state from one&nbsp;gurdwara to another. The custom  originated in the time of Guru Gobind Singh&nbsp;who held the first such  mock fight event at&nbsp;Anandpur in February  1701.<br ar="all" />
