     <td width="483"><p align="justify" class="style18 style12">The Kesh, or uncut, long hair, is considered by Sikhs as an  indispensable part of the human body. Long known as a sign of spiritual  devotion, it also emulates the appearance of&nbsp;Guru Gobind Singh&nbsp;and is one of the primary signs by which  a Sikh can be clearly and quickly identified. A Sikh never cuts or trims any  hair as a symbol of respect for the perfection of God's creation. The uncut  long hair and the&nbsp;beard, in the case of men, form the main kakār for  Sikhs.<br />
        The turban is a spiritual crown, which is a constant reminder to  the Sikh that he or she is sitting on the throne of consciousness and is  committed to living according to Sikh principles. Guru Gobind Singh told his  Sikhs:<br />
&quot;Khaalsa mero roop hai khaas. Khaalsa mai  ho karo nivaas... The Khalsa is my image. Within the Khalsa I reside.&quot;&nbsp;Wearing a turban declares sovereignty,  dedication, self-respect, courage and piety.<br/>

    <td width="483"><p class="style20">A&nbsp;Kangha&nbsp;is  a small wooden comb that Sikhs use twice a day. It is supposed to be worn only  in the hair and at all times. Combs help to clean and remove tangles from the  hair, and is a symbol of cleanliness. Combing their hair reminds Sikhs that  their lives should be tidy and organized.<br />
      The comb keeps the hair tidy, a symbol of not just accepting  what God has given, but also an injunction to maintain it with grace. The Guru  Gobind Singh said hair should be allowed to grow naturally; this excludes any  shaving for both men and women. In the Guru's time, some holy men let their  hair become tangled and dirty. The Guru said that this was not right; that hair  should be allowed to grow but it should be kept clean and combed at least twice  a day.<br clear="all" />

      The Sikhs were  commanded by Guru Gobind Singh at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699 to wear <br />
      an iron bracelet called a  Kara at all times. The Kara is a constant reminder to always remember that  whatever a person does with their hands has to be in keeping with the advice  given by the Guru. The Kara is an iron/steel circle to symbolise God as never  ending. It is a symbol of permanent bonding to the community, of being a link  in the chain of Khalsa Sikhs (the word for link is &quot;kari&quot;)<br clear="all" />

    <td><p class="style20">Originally, the Kachmemeosera was made part of the five Ks as a  symbol of a Sikh soldier's willingness to be ready at a moment's notice for  battle or for defence. The confirmed Sikh (one who has taken the Amrit) wears a  Kachera every day. Some go to the extent of wearing a Kacheraye while bathing,  to be ready to at a moment's notice, changing into the new one a single leg at  a time, so as to have no moment where they are unprepared. Further, this  garment allowed the Sikh soldier to operate in combat freely and without any  hindrance or restriction, because it was easy to fabricate, maintain, wash and  carry compared to other traditional under-garments of that era, like the&nbsp;dhoti. The Kachera symbolises self-respect, and always reminds the  wearer of mental control over lust, one of the&nbsp;Five Evils in Sikh philosophy.</p></td>

    <td><p class="style20">The&nbsp;kirpan&nbsp;is  a dagger which symbolizes a Sikh's duty to come to the defence of those in  peril. All Sikhs should wear kirpan on their body at all times as a defensive  side-arm, just as a police officer is expected to wear a side-arm when on duty.  Its use is only allowed in the act of self-defense and the protection of others.  It stands for bravery and protecting the weak and innocent.<br />
      The kirpan is kept sharp and is actually used to defend others,  such as those who are oppressed by harsh rulers, women who are raped in the  streets, or a person who was being robbed or beaten. The true Sikh cannot turn  a blind eye to such evils, thinking that they are &quot;someone else's  concern.&quot;[<em>citation needed]</em>&nbsp;It is the duty of the true Sikh to help those who suffer  unjustly, by whatever means available, whether that means alerting the police,  summoning help, or literally defending those who cannot defend themselves, even  if that means putting oneself in harm's way.</p></td>
