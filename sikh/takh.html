      Akal Takhat Sahib literally means Eternal Throne. It is also part of the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar. Its foundation was laid by Guru Hargobind Ji, the sixth Sikh Guru. The Akal Takhat is situated opposite to Harmandir Sahib and are connected by a passage. The building of the Akal Takht opposite the Golden Temple has a special meaning. While the Golden Temple stands for spiritual guidance the Akal Takhat symbolizes the dispensing of justice and temporal activity. In earlier days all Sikh warriors sought blessings here before going to battle fields. During the 18th century while Sikhs were fighting a guerrilla war in the forests they used to gather at the Akal Takat on special occasions such as Vaisakhi . Here the community used to have general meetings and approve resolutions. The Akal Takht is the oldest of the Five Takhatscle.<br ar="all" />
